# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive testing agent that will automatically validate all built features in the GoCars taxi booking platform. The testing agent will simulate real user interactions, identify issues, and provide automated fixes for any errors found. The system needs to test Firebase integration, WebSocket communication, notification systems, chat functionality, AI features, authentication, booking workflows, and all UI components.

5. WHEN testing concurrent users THEN the system SHALL validate system performance under load

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want notification system testing, so that I can ensure users receive timely and relevant notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing push notifications THEN the system SHALL validate FCM integration, token management, and message delivery
2. WHEN testing intelligent notification management THEN the system SHALL validate AI-powered optimization, batching, and personalization
3. WHEN testing notification templates THEN the system SHALL validate template rendering, localization, and dynamic content
4. WHEN testing notification preferences THEN the system SHALL validate user settings, do-not-disturb modes, and filtering
5. WHEN testing notification analytics THEN the system SHALL validate delivery tracking, engagement metrics, and reporting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated error detection and fixing, so that I can maintain system stability with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and impact
2. WHEN fixable errors are found THEN the system SHALL attempt automated repairs using predefined solutions
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL re-run affected tests to validate the repairs
4. WHEN complex errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and recommended manual fixes
5. WHEN fixes are completed THEN the system SHALL update relevant documentation and logs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive UI component testing, so that I can ensure all interface elements work correctly across different devices and browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing UI components THEN the system SHALL validate rendering, responsiveness, and accessibility
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL validate clicks, form submissions, and navigation
3. WHEN testing mobile compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate touch interactions and responsive design
4. WHEN testing browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across major browsers
5. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL validate load times, memory usage, and rendering efficiency

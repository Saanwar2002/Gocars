# Comprehensive Testing Framework

This directory contains a complete testing framework for the GoCars application, providing multiple layers of testing to ensure code quality, performance, and reliability.

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

The testing framework is organized into several key components:

```
src/testing/
├── framework/           # Core testing framework and utilities
├── setup/              # Test configuration and setup files
├── unit/               # Unit tests for components and utilities
├── integration/        # Integration tests for API endpoints
├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests with Playwright
├── performance/       # Performance and load testing
├── mocks/             # Mock data and services
└── reporters/         # Custom test reporters and output
```

## 🧪 Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Test API endpoints and service integrations
- **Location**: `src/testing/integration/`
- **Run**: `npm run test:integration`

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows across multiple browsers
- **Location**: `src/testing/e2e/`

## 📊 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
The Jest configuration is defined in `jest.config.js` and includes:
- TypeScript support with ts-jest
- React Testing Library setup
- Coverage reporting with thresholds
- Custom reporters for detailed output
- Module path mapping for clean imports

### Playwright Configuration
The Playwright configuration is defined in `playwright.config.ts` and includes:
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing
- Parallel test execution
- Video recording on failures
- HTML and JSON reporting

## 🛠️ Custom Testing Framework

### TestRunner Class
The `TestRunner` class provides a comprehensive testing framework with:
- Parallel and sequential test execution
- Retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Performance metrics collection
- Memory usage monitoring
- Detailed reporting and logging

```typescript
import { TestRunner } from './framework/TestRunner';

const runner = new TestRunner({
  parallel: true,
  maxConcurrency: 4,
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 2,
  verbose: true,
});

// Add test suites
runner.addSuite({
  name: 'My Test Suite',
  description: 'Testing core functionality',
  tests: [
    {
      name: 'should work correctly',
      test: async () => {
        // Your test logic here
      },
    },
  ],
});

// Run tests
const results = await runner.run();
```

### Load Testing
The `LoadTester` class provides performance testing capabilities:

```typescript
import { LoadTester } from './performance/loadTesting';

const loadTester = new LoadTester();

const result = await loadTester.runLoadTest({
  concurrent: 20,
  duration: 30000, // 30 seconds
  rampUp: 5000,    // 5 seconds
  target: '/api/rides',
  timeout: 5000,
});

console.log(`Average response time: ${result.averageResponseTime}ms`);
console.log(`Requests per second: ${result.requestsPerSecond}`);
```

## 📈 Performance Testing

### API Performance Tests
- Load testing for critical endpoints
- Concurrent user simulation
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Memory usage analysis

### Component Performance Tests
- Rendering performance measurement
- Memory leak detection
- Large dataset handling
- Virtual scrolling performance

### Database Performance Tests
- Query execution time
- Connection pool efficiency
- Transaction performance
- Index optimization validation

## 🎯 Test Coverage

The framework enforces comprehensive test coverage with the following thresholds:
- **Branches**: 80%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%
- **Statements**: 80%

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
- HTML report: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- JSON summary: `coverage/coverage-summary.json`
- LCOV format: `coverage/lcov.info`

## 📋 Test Reports

### HTML Dashboard
A comprehensive HTML dashboard is generated showing:
- Test suite results
- Performance metrics
- Coverage information
- Failure details
- Execution timeline

### JSON Reports
Detailed JSON reports include:

- Performance data
- Error information
- Environment details

### JUnit XML
JUnit-compatible XML reports for CI/CD integration.

// Generate test data
const testUser = testUtils.generateUser({
  name: 'Custom Name',
  email: 'custom@example.com',
});

const testRide = testUtils.generateRide({
  status: 'completed',
  fare: 25.50,
});
```

## 🌐 Cross-Browser Testing

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: Run comprehensive tests
  run: |
    npm run test:ci
    npm run test:e2e
    npm run test:performance
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Debug unit tests
npm run test:unit -- --debug

# Debug E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- Button.test.tsx
```

### Test Isolation
Each test runs in isolation with:
- Fresh component instances
- Clean mock state
- Isolated browser contexts
- Separate database transactions

## 📚 Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
2. **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on user interactions
3. **Use descriptive test names**: Make failures easy to understand
4. **Keep tests independent**: No shared state between tests
5. **Mock external dependencies**: Isolate units under test

### Performance Testing
1. **Establish baselines**: Know your current performance
2. **Test realistic scenarios**: Use production-like data
3. **Monitor trends**: Track performance over time
4. **Set meaningful thresholds**: Based on user experience
5. **Test under load**: Simulate real-world usage

### E2E Testing
1. **Test critical paths**: Focus on core user journeys
2. **Use page objects**: Maintain reusable page interactions
3. **Handle async operations**: Wait for elements properly
4. **Test across browsers**: Ensure cross-browser compatibility
5. **Keep tests stable**: Avoid flaky tests with proper waits

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests timing out**
- Increase timeout values in configuration
- Check for unresolved promises
- Ensure proper cleanup in teardown

**Flaky tests**
- Add proper waits for async operations
- Use retry mechanisms
- Check for race conditions

**Memory leaks in tests**
- Clean up event listeners
- Clear timers and intervals
- Reset global state

**Performance test failures**
- Check system resources
- Verify network conditions
- Review baseline expectations
